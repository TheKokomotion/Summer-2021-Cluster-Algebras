# Current filler is using weight cluster W, which I imagine is a list compiled from weight vectors [d, d_1, d_2],
# yada yada, which I will adapt once we determine how we are storing weight vectors from mutations.


# from FutureFunction import W:
#   for i in range(1, len(W)):
#       d = [W[i][0]]
#       d_1 = [W[i][1]]
#       d_2 = [W[i][2]]

# May add query what type of scale we want to graph our weight vectors on
# scale = input("Plot 'linear' or 'logarithmic':")

# Linear version
# if scale = linear:
#    plt.plot(d, d_1, d_2)
#    plt.axis(0, max(d), 0, max(d_1), 0, max(d_2))
